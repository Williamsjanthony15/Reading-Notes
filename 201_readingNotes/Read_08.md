### Controlling the position of elements
  <ul>
    <li>Block level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, While inline boxes flow between surrounding text. you can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes( and sometimes the height, too). To seperatee boxes, yoiu can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.</li>
    <li>Css treats HTML elemeent as if its is in its own box. This box will either be a "Block-Level" box or an "inline" box.</li>
    <li>block level elemeents - Start on a new line.<li>
    <li>Inline elements - flow in between surround text </li>
  </uL>
  <ul>
    <li>Containing Elements</li>
    <li>If one block-level element ists inside another block level element than the outer box is known as the "containing" or "parent" element. It is common to group a number of elements together inside a < div > (or other block-level Elements). For example you might roup together all of the element sthat form the header of a site(such as the logo and the main navigation). the div elemeents is then referred to as the "Containing" element.
