My opinion of this article is that, Nothing in life is Free, Easy, or able to be completed to full capacity without a Team. I mean think about it. What do you do in life that isnt either A. Accomplished by a team, or B. Provided for by a team? I'll wait... 
Marriage? - Team
Work? - Team
Sports? - obviously a team.
Hell even going to the bathroom! if you didnt have running water you couldnt use it! which is done by a team!

Google wasnt even made with a team. Larry Page or Sergey Brin couldnt have done what they did, without the other. Thats why when you google** Founders of Google.... Larry Page and Sergey Brin come up. Not one or the other.
