    <li> Ordered List's </li>
      <ol> 
        <li>Are lists where each item in the list is numbered</li>
        <li> For Example the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each pooint n eeds to be identified by a section number.</li>
        <li> Ordered lists are designated with <'ol'></li>
        <li> Sometimes You see a type attribute with OL but it is better to be used with CSS</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Unordered List's </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order)</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Devifintion Lists</li>
      <ul>
        <dl> Are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.</dl>
          <li>The definition is used with the dl element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the dl element you will usually see pairs of DT and DD elements</li>
          <li>Dr is used to contain the term being defined, The definition Term.</li>
          <li> DD is used to contain the definition, sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definitions for the same term.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Nested lists</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You can put a second list inside an li elemenet to create a sublist or nested list</li>
        <li>browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browsers will usually change the style of the bullet point too.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
