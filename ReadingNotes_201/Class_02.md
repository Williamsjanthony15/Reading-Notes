## HTML & CSS

### Chapter 2: "text"

    Notes: Tags in text for HTML is known as "Markup".
    
    Structural Markup: The elemenets that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
    
    Semantic Markup: Which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on. 

"h" Tags are the same premise as # tags in Markdown. less number larger text, Higher number smaller text.

"p" for paragraph. <p> to open it. </p> to close it. 

"b" open and close for Bold

"i" open and close for Italic 

Both the "i" and "b" tags are utilized inside of a tag IE:

<p> I am using <b> Bold </b> and <i> Italics </i> for this sentance. </p>

"sup" sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power. This puts in above the letters. 

IE: Water is 2 parts hydrogen and 1 part oxygen. H<sup>2</sup>O. 

"sub" element is used to contain characters that should be subscipt it is commonly used with foot notes. This puts it below the numbers.

IE: Water is 2 parts hydrogen and 1 part oxygen.  H<sub>2</sub>O

### Chapter 10: "Introducing CSS"

    Notes: CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specifiy that the background of the page is cream, all paragrpahs should appear in gray using the arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, times type face.

        Logical OR 
        Logical NOT

        If statments : the if statement evaluates or checks a condition. if the condition evaluates to true. any statment in the subsequent code block are executed. 

        If else statments: The if....Else statment checks a condition. if it resolves to true the first code block is executed. if the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead. 
        
        Switch Statments: a switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a posible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
