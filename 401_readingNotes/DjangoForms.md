## Django Forms 

Working with forms

HTML Forms in Django, and, in particular, the easiest way to write forms to create, update, and delete model instances.

Overview
An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.


Developers need to write HTML for the form, validate and properly sanitize entered data on the server (and possibly also in the browser), repost the form with error messages to inform users of any invalid fields, handle the data when it has successfully been submitted, and finally respond to the user in some way to indicate success


HTML Forms
First a brief overview of HTML Forms. Consider a simple HTML form, with a single text field for entering the name of some "team", and its associated label

The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit".

<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>

The submit input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server (in this case, just the team_name). The form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action):

action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.
method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.
The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.
The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.


Django form handling process
Django's form handling uses all of the same techniques that we learned about in previous tutorials (for displaying information about our models): the view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page (from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed). What makes things more complicated is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.

A process flowchart of how Django handles form requests is shown below, starting with a request for a page containing a form (shown in green).

Updated form handling process doc.

Based on the diagram above, the main things that Django's form handling does are:

Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.
The form may contain blank fields (e.g. if you're creating a new record), or it may be pre-populated with initial values (e.g. if you are changing a record, or have useful default initial values).
The form is referred to as unbound at this point, because it isn't associated with any user-entered data (though it may have initial values).
Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
Binding data to the form means that the user-entered data and any errors are available when we need to redisplay the form.
Clean and validate the data.
Cleaning the data performs sanitization of the input (e.g. removing invalid characters that might be used to send malicious content to the server) and converts them into consistent Python types.
Validation checks that the values are appropriate for the field (e.g. are in the right date range, aren't too short or too long, etc.)
If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.
If all data is valid, perform required actions (e.g. save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)
Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

Form
The Form class is the heart of Django's form handling system. It specifies the fields in the form, their layout, display widgets, labels, initial values, valid values, and (once validated) the error messages associated with invalid fields. The class also provides methods for rendering itself in templates using predefined formats (tables, lists, etc.) or for getting the value of any element (enabling fine-grained manual rendering).

Declaring a Form
The declaration syntax for a Form is very similar to that for declaring a Model, and shares the same field types (and some similar parameters). This makes sense because in both cases we need to ensure that each field handles the right types of data, is constrained to valid data, and has a description for display/documentation.

Form data is stored in an application's forms.py file, inside the application directory. Create and open the file locallibrary/catalog/forms.py. To create a Form, we import the forms library, derive from the Form class, and declare the form's fields. A very basic form class for our library book renewal form is shown below — add this to your new file:

from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")

Form fields
In this case, we have a single DateField for entering the renewal date that will render in HTML with a blank value, the default label "Renewal date:", and some helpful usage text: "Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3 weeks)." As none of the other optional arguments are specified the field will accept dates using the input_formats: YYYY-MM-DD (2016-11-06), MM/DD/YYYY (02/26/2016), MM/DD/YY (10/25/16), and will be rendered using the default widget: DateInput.

The arguments that are common to most fields are listed below (these have sensible default values):

required: If True, the field may not be left blank or given a None value. Fields are required by default, so you would set required=False to allow blank values in the form.
label: The label to use when rendering the field in HTML. If a label is not specified, Django will create one from the field name by capitalizing the first letter and replacing underscores with spaces (e.g. Renewal date).
label_suffix: By default, a colon is displayed after the label (e.g. Renewal date:). This argument allows you to specify a different suffix containing other character(s).
initial: The initial value for the field when the form is displayed.
widget: The display widget to use.
help_text (as seen in the example above): Additional text that can be displayed in forms to explain how to use the field.
error_messages: A list of error messages for the field. You can override these with your own messages if needed.
validators: A list of functions that will be called on the field when it is validated.
localize: Enables the localization of form data input (see link for more information).
disabled: The field is displayed but its value cannot be edited if this is True. The default is False.
Validation
Django provides numerous places where you can validate your data. The easiest way to validate a single field is to override the method clean_<fieldname>() for the field you want to check. So for example, we can validate that entered renewal_date values are between now and 4 weeks by implementing clean_renewal_date() as shown below.

Update your forms.py file so it looks like this:


import datetime

from django import forms

from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")

    def clean_renewal_date(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data['renewal_date']

        # Check if a date is not in the past.
        if data < datetime.date.today():
            raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal in past'))

        # Check if a date is in the allowed range (+4 weeks from today).
        if data > datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=4):
            raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal more than 4 weeks ahead'))

        # Remember to always return the cleaned data.
        return data
