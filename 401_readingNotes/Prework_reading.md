# Prework - Prep your mindset 

## Watch Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset (10 minutes)

The power of yet...

Having the grade state "not yet" rather than "failing" will push the students to feel like they are on a learning curve and continue to push them to succeed rather than give up. 

Students that were given a test that was harder than they were ready for, Had two outputs, one output being a postitive "growth Mindset" -- I love a challenge, it was more informative, Learning more. The other output was a Negative "fixed mindset" feeling overwhelmed or upset because of their lack of knowledge, and they said if they were to get this test again, they would most likly Cheat vs. studying more. They also looked for someone who did worse than they did, so they could feel better about them. Nuerologist found that Growth minset student's mind had huge activity, when they came accross adversity. 


What can we do to build that bridge to yet. 

Praise wisely. 
  Not praising the intellegence or talent, That has "failed"
  Praising the process that kids engage in.
    Making kids hardy, and resillient

Studnets that were not taught the yet concept had continously declining grades during the difficult school transition

Students that WERE taught the yet concept had countinously increasing grades. 



## Watch Alain de Botton on Redefining Success (17 minutes)

Opinion of Our lives are constantly puncuated by career crisis. That moments of what we thought we knew, comes in contact with a unfortunate reality. 

Reasons why we may feel anxiety from our career.

 - surrounded by snobs
 - Opposite of snobs is like your mother, that doesnt care about your achievments but care about you for you being there. 
 - The hope we all have for our careers. (Any one can achieve anything)
 - "we are all equal" - no heiracrhy 
  - Equality creates envy
  - If you can relate to them you cant envy


**Meritocratic Society - If you've gotten the talent and energy and skill, you will get to the top, nothing should hold you back.  -- THe problem is, If you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top, get to the top, You'll also by implication and in a far more nasty way, believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom, get to the bottom... And stay there...

** Big Quote... "Hold your horses when you come to judge somebody, You dont know what someones TRUE value is. That is an Unkown part of them, and we should behave as thought it is known" **

## Watch Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit (6 minutes)

What if doing well in school and in life, Depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? 

Out of an eclectic and diverse group of study groups, There was one common denomenator, of the "success" of these people, That is "grit". Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.

I think Angela Lee, (so far) has had the best video. I mainly think this because she is taking Scientific data, Accumilated data from her own studies and coming up with a hypothesis. She defines the need for children in school and adults in jobs... so on and so forth to be successfull by the level of determination and grit they have to become successfull.


## Listen to The Drs. Sarah on Impostor Syndrome - Pt 1 (30 minutes)
### Self Care with Drs. Sarah: Imposter Syndrome / 2

Def. the feeling of being a faker or an imposter. Even though you have consistantly proven you are not, and that you have phsical evidence of your success, You continue to think you are not in the right spot and shouldnt/cant do this.

Imposter syndrom comes in all shapes and sizes. Regardless of what educational or job status group your in, It can still find you. You always will feel like the next thing and then the next thing and then the next thing will be your failure. You will always make excuses to make it seems like you doing well is in error. 


Sometimes you begin to feel like you are proceeding that people feel sorry for you, because you try so hard and your so close and they give you that last bit because they feel bad for you... When in all reality you deserve it and completed it to a passing standards

The Thoughts may never go away. They just move to another thing that you feel this way about...

No matter how much we continue to belief imposter syndrom, it is almost ALWAYS incorrect and factually proven wrong. 

## Read Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice (10 minutes)

### Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

"If you build software you program every day. That doesn't mean you get better at programming every day." -- I really like this quote. 

This Level of software development and school / knowledge doesnt happen by accident. Though you will get rewarded with one application after another, to increase and boost your technical skills however, youll need to apply deliberate practice. 

" the mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. if you walk into a music hall at a local university, youll hear people playing by running through thier pieces.
This is a huge mistake. strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of thier music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety." -- Cal Newport 

Practicing software development and coding should be challenging and technically difficult and pushing you to the best of your abilities. Not creating applications, websites and games. As a web developer, opportunities for really pushing yoursel come few and far between. you cant rely on your day job to continually challenge you. 

Deliberate practice is defined by. 
- pushes you just outside your comfort zone
- repeated often
- feedback on results in continuously available
- its highly demanding mentally
- its difficult 
- it requires good goals

in software development and coding, we really are self taught and self challenged. If we are faced with difficulty the only bit of reward we get is when the application or technical piece were working on is when it works. 

* the matasano crypto challenges -- are great example of a set of exercises that meet these criterria for the majority of intermediate to senior level developers.
