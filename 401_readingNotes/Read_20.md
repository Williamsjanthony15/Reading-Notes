## Object-relational mapper
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table

### Example 

class Band(models.Model):
    """A model of a rock band."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    can_rock = models.BooleanField(default=True)


class Member(models.Model):
    """A model of a rock band member."""
    name = models.CharField("Member's name", max_length=200)
    instrument = models.CharField(choices=(
            ('g', "Guitar"),
            ('b', "Bass"),
            ('d', "Drums"),
        ),
        max_length=1
    )
    band = models.ForeignKey("Band")
    

### The basics:

Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API;

Quick example¶
This example model defines a Person, which has a first_name and last_name:

from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
first_name and last_name are fields of the model. Each field is specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a database column.

The above Person model would create a database table like this:

CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
);
Some technical notes:

The name of the table, myapp_person, is automatically derived from some model metadata but can be overridden. See Table names for more details.
An id field is added automatically, but this behavior can be overridden. See Automatic primary key fields.
The CREATE TABLE SQL in this example is formatted using PostgreSQL syntax, but it’s worth noting Django uses SQL tailored to the database backend specified in your settings file.

    
    
## URLs and views

A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.

To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

### Example

from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('bands/', views.band_listing, name='band-list'),
    path('bands/<int:band_id>/', views.band_detail, name='band-detail'),
    path('bands/search/', views.band_search, name='band-search'),
]
      
from django.shortcuts import render

def band_listing(request):
    """A view of all bands."""
    bands = models.Band.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'bands/band_listing.html', {'bands': bands})


## Templates
Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

### Example

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Band Listing</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>All Bands</h1>
    <ul>
    {% for band in bands %}
      <li>
        <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
        {% if band.can_rock %}<p>This band can rock!</p>{% endif %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>

## Forms
Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

### Example

from django import forms

class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField()
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
      

## Authentication

Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

### Example

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.shortcuts import render

@login_required
def my_protected_view(request):
    """A view that can only be accessed by logged-in users"""
    return render(request, 'protected.html', {'current_user': request.user})

## Admin

One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. It’s easy to set up and provides many hooks for customization.

### Example

from django.contrib import admin
from bands.models import Band, Member

class MemberAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    """Customize the look of the auto-generated admin for the Member model"""
    list_display = ('name', 'instrument')
    list_filter = ('band',)

admin.site.register(Band)  # Use the default options
admin.site.register(Member, MemberAdmin)  # Use the customized options

## Internationalization

Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize web applications for particular users according to their preferences.

### Example

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.utils.translation import gettext

def homepage(request):
    """
    Shows the homepage with a welcome message that is translated in the
    user's language.
    """
    message = gettext('Welcome to our site!')
    return render(request, 'homepage.html', {'message': message})

#### HTML
{% load i18n %}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{% trans 'Homepage - Hall of Fame' %}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {# Translated in the view: #}
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans count member_count=bands.count %}
      Here is the only band in the hall of fame:
      {% plural %}
      Here are all the {{ member_count }} bands in the hall of fame:
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <ul>
    {% for band in bands %}
      <li>
        <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
        {% if band.can_rock %}<p>{% trans 'This band can rock!' %}</p>{% endif %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>


## Security

Django provides multiple protections against:

Clickjacking
Cross-site scripting
Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
SQL injection
Remote code execution
