SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences

SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.

SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.

SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries.

SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.

In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable.

For high transactional based application: SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data.

Excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors.

SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )

On a high-level, we can classify SQL databases as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors.
