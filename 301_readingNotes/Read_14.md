What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys. This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

Gave them an advantage in the computer science industry. 


What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
1. There are men and women in the Tech industry. 
2. Not really sure what the data set is? but it may look like percentages. If so The percentages are relatively even
3. The data is rather old and out dated but still a good historical document on the movement of adding Multicultural entities to the work force. 

When are diversity efforts most successful?
- I dont believe diversity efforts make them successful. I Believe you are successfull by having the most qualified individuals. To me, Have a diversity clause in your company means your HAVE to hire so many X or so many Y's... Why not just hire who is qualified? 
Why do diverse companies perform better?
- I dont believe you can evaluate, a company by their production based on diversified tactics rather than qualified individuals maximizing production in turn maximizing profit. 
Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa. Im not sure what this is asking. but i believe regardless anybody can do anything.... No matter the color of your skin, or the sex of which you were born.
