## OAuth definition
OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.

## OAuth History
Created and strongly supported from the start by Twitter, Google and other companies, OAuth was released as an open standard in 2010 as RFC 5849, and quickly became widely adopted. Over the next two years, it underwent substantial revision, and version 2.0 of OAuth, was released in 2012 as RFC 6749. Even though version 2.0 was widely criticized for multiple reasons covered below, it gained even more popularity. Today, you can add Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, Paypal and a list of other internet who’s-whos as adopters.

## How OAuth works

1. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
2. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
3. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
4. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
5. If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
6. The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
7. The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
8. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
9. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
10. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
11. The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
12. OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly.
 What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).
 
 ## OAuth vs. OpenID
 There are a couple of other security technologies that you might hear about in the same context as OAuth, and one of them is OpenID. At a base level, the distinction between the two is simple to grasp. Remember when we said up above that the auth in OAuth stood for authorization, not authentication? Well, OpenID is about authentication: as a commenter on StackOverflow pithily put it: "OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans."
 
 ## OAuth vs. SAML
 The Security Assertion Markup Language, or SAML, is another technology you'll hear talked about in the same breath as OAuth. Strictly speaking, the name SAML refers to an XML variant language, but the term can also cover various protocol messages and profiles that make up part of the open SAML standard.
 
 ## OAuth2
 There are no perfect universal internet-wide authentication standards. OAuth is particularly maligned because of the drastic changes between versions 1.0 and 2.0. In many ways, OAuth2 is less secure, more complex and less prescriptive than version 1.0. Version 2.0 creators focused on making OAuth more interoperable and flexible between sites and devices.
