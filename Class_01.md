Day one Class. Will HREF from Main Table of contents. Reading/Skimming
Chapters 1, 8, 17, and 18
JavaScript Chapter 1




## Structure

Structure is probably the number 1 most over thought process of anything in life..... Wihtout structure in your page, everything is going to look like one giant mess and will be unreadable. The End user will get lost in the content and not know what to take from it and what not to. With that being said. Here are some of the top notes from Chapter 1. 

  <ul>
    <li>Headings and Subheadings. </li>
        Need to be clear and consise. Its your first impression of your pages hiearchy.
    <li>HTML describes the "Structure" of pages.</li>
        Like i said before. Without some form of structure, there is just a blob of confusion floating in space.
    <li>Utilizing Elemenets to Define the Structure</li>
      Elements define structure. By utilizing elements you can easily decipher where the Heading, paragraph, and footer, begings and ends. 
          Tags are the containers inside of the elements. IE Paragraphs. <p> </p>
    <li>"Sourcing"</li>
      Some people call it cheating, I call it Open book testing. 
            I have always been a fan of looking at other peoples work and making something your own based on other idea's. Whether or not that is their format, "Structure" or designs. 
    <li>HTML's ARE TEXT DOCUMENTS</li>
      Something i continue to have to remind myself. I am constantly trying to do too much in the HTML, when in all reality. its just the words in your page, let CSS and JS do the rest!
  </ul>
  
  ## Extra MarkUp
  
  <ul>
    <li>Specifying different versions of HTML</li>
       To Name a few.
        <li>Html4</li>
        <li>X Html 1.0</li>
        <li> Html5 </li>
   
   <li>Identifying and Grouping Elements</li>
          Each Element can carry an ID Attribute
            ID Attributers uniquely idenitfy that element from other elemenets.
    
   <li>Comments, Meta Information and Iframes</li>
        Comments are identified as  
  </ul>
  
  ## HTML 5 Layout
  
  This is the summary page from the book, reading this chapter was kind of hard to pull notes from without just understanding it. Definelty something i would like to study more but not something i feel needed to spend to much time on at the moment. WIll follow up on at a later time. 
  <ul>
    <li>The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose different parts ofa webpage and help to describe its structure. </li>
    <li>The new elements provide clearer code (comapred with using multiple <div> elements). </li>
    <li>Older browers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements</li>
    <li>To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE) extra javascript is needed, which is available free from google</li>
  </ul>
  
  
 ## ABC's of Programming
 
  I have read this chapter word for word, over and under, up and down, left and right. This is one of those things that you need to fully 100% understand before you can go on to learn more. I fully believe, if you cant grasp a foundational concept of JS, you should not keep reading further. It will turn you around before you even know you left. More to read from this, Great list of notes on such. Will most likely read again. regardless of my experience level.
